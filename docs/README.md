# OctoAcme Project Management: Overview

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. This guide provides a high-level introduction to how we manage and deliver cross-functional initiatives.

## Purpose

OctoAcme's project management framework emphasizes **efficient**, **collaborative**, and **transparent** delivery of cross-functional initiatives. Our approach provides a structured lifecycle from initiation through retrospectives, ensuring teams deliver value consistently while fostering continuous improvement.

## Key Workflows

Our project lifecycle follows a clear, iterative structure:

1. **Initiation**: Define the problem statement, identify stakeholders, and establish high-level timelines
2. **Planning**: Scope the work, allocate resources, set milestones, and map dependencies
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate in small increments
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy to production, verify functionality, and communicate changes
5. **Retrospective**: Capture learnings, celebrate wins, and identify improvement opportunities

Throughout execution, we use **project boards** for task tracking, enabling real-time visibility into progress and blockers.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Each project involves clearly defined roles working together:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, manages schedules, tracks risks, and facilitates team communication
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success against customer value
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design decisions, and ensure technical quality
- **QA/Testing**: Validate acceptance criteria, execute test plans, and verify quality standards

Each role has specific responsibilities with clear handoff points and collaboration patterns to ensure smooth delivery.

## Communication Strategies

Effective communication keeps projects on track and aligned:

- **Regular Standups**: Team syncs (typically twice weekly or as agreed) to share progress, surface blockers, and coordinate work
- **PM + PdM Weekly Sync**: Alignment on priorities, scope changes, and strategic decisions
- **Monthly Stakeholder Updates**: Broader communication to keep leadership and partners informed
- **Clear Escalation Paths**: Well-defined processes for raising and resolving blockers quickly

All communication emphasizes transparency, enabling proactive problem-solving and maintaining alignment across the organization.

## Quality Practices

Quality assurance is integrated throughout our delivery process:

- **Code Reviews**: Peer review of all changes to ensure maintainability, correctness, and knowledge sharing
- **Automated Testing**: Continuous validation through unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Manual Testing**: QA validation of acceptance criteria and user workflows
- **Deployment Checklists**: Structured pre-release verification to catch issues before production
- **Post-Release Retrospectives**: Structured reflection sessions to identify what worked, what didn't, and actions for improvement

This multi-layered approach ensures we deliver reliable, high-quality solutions while continuously learning and improving our processes.
